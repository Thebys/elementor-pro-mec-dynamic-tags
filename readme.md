# Remarks
- So far no support for multiple events / calendar views.
- This plugin overrides all default template(s) for MEC single event. The intention is to use default one and especially let Elementor handle it all. Plugin template (templates/single-mec-events.php) used to replace the MEC default one is taken from Elementor Hello Theme Template, feel free to change it.
- Performance will probably be nightmare bad, query code written by AI in render methods.
